I've seen a few sites using Zola (well, more like a single), and it
looks pretty good in my opinion - and hey, if that's what it takes to
prevent myself from reinventing the wheel, great!

I just need to figure out more I guess, especially with regards to its
templating capabilities, and CLI usage.
